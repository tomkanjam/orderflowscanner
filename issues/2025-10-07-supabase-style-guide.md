# Supabase-Style Design System Implementation

**Status**: 🎨 design
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Priority**: Medium

## Overview

Implement Supabase's design system styling across the application using shadcn/ui components. This is not a layout overhaul, but a comprehensive style refresh to match Supabase's visual design language while maintaining our current application structure.

## Idea Review

### Problem
The current application has custom styling but lacks the polish and consistency of a professional design system. Supabase's dashboard has excellent visual design with:
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Excellent color palette (dark mode focused)
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Professional component styling
- Subtle animations and transitions

### Proposed Solution
1. Deep research into Supabase's design system (colors, typography, spacing, components)
2. Install and configure shadcn/ui as component library
3. Create comprehensive style guide page showcasing all styled components
4. Apply styling component-by-component starting with sidebar/top bar
5. Maintain current layout and functionality - only visual updates

### Goals
- Professional, polished UI matching Supabase quality
- Reusable shadcn/ui components for faster development
- Comprehensive style guide for consistency
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability
- Better dark mode implementation

### Non-Goals
- Changing application layout/structure
- Removing or relocating features
- Changing data flow or state management
- Major functional changes

## Research Phase

### Supabase Design Analysis
*To be filled after deep research*

### Component Inventory
Current components to be restyled:
- Sidebar (navigation, filters)
- Top bar (logo, stats, user menu)
- Signal cards
- Chart components
- Modals
- Forms (TraderForm)
- Buttons and inputs
- Tables
