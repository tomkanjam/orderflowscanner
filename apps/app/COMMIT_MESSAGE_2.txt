fix: Prevent WebSocket disconnection every minute

- Remove traders array from WebSocket effect dependencies
- Use traderIntervalsKey instead to track only actual interval changes
- Update traderIntervalsKey to include all requiredTimeframes, not just refresh interval
- Change dependency comment to reflect new behavior

This fixes the issue where the WebSocket would disconnect and show "Offline"
every minute when traders run their filters. Now the connection stays stable
and only reconnects when trader intervals actually change.
