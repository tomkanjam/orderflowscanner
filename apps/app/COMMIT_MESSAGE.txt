fix: Fix WebSocket URL format and add message debugging

- Change WebSocket URL from /ws/ to /stream?streams= format for multiple streams
- Add debug logging to track first WebSocket message received
- Add window.__firstMessageLogged to debug tracking interface

This fixes the WebSocket connection to use the correct Binance API format
for multiple streams and adds debugging to investigate why ticker updates
aren't being tracked in the StatusBar (showing 0/s and "--" for last update).
