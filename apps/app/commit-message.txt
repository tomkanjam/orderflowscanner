fix: Fix WebSocket connection and multi-timeframe data loading issues

- Increase WebSocket connection delay to 500ms to avoid React StrictMode cleanup
- Fix loadInitialData to fetch all required timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m) for traders
- Add condition to wait for traders before loading data
- Add comprehensive debug logging to track connection and data flow
- Ensure StatusBar receives proper update callbacks

These fixes resolve:
- "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established" errors
- Traders reporting "insufficient data for required timeframes"
- StatusBar showing 0/s update rate
- Missing signals due to incomplete multi-timeframe data
