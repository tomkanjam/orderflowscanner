# Prevent deletion of active traders

**Type:** enhancement
**Initiative:** End-to-end trader workflow implementation
**Created:** 2025-10-29 13:46:28

## Context
Currently, traders can be deleted regardless of their active/inactive status. This creates a safety risk where users could accidentally delete traders that are actively monitoring or trading. We need to enforce that traders must be inactive before they can be deleted, similar to production trading platforms.
